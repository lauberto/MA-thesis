# MA-thesis
Repository to store all data and code for my master thesis on ProDrop in Russian Texts.

## Higher School of Economics, Moscow
## Faculty of Humanities
## Магистерская программа "Компьютерная лингвистика"

To run the code, download the repository and run all the cells in MA-thesis/scipts/prodrop.ipynb (you are going to need Juyter Notebook or similar).
In the end you are going to visualize the results, which are also reported in the thesis paper.
